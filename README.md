questions related to stacks
1)Balanced Parentheses:
Write a function to check if a given string of parentheses is balanced. You can use a stack to solve this problem.

2)Evaluate Postfix Expression:
Given a postfix expression (in reverse Polish notation) as a string, write a function to evaluate it using a stack. The expression consists of integers and operators (+, -, *, /).

3)Next Greater Element:
Given an array of integers, for each element, find the next greater element to its right. If there is no greater element, return -1 for that element. Implement this using a stack.

4)Min Stack:
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time. Implement this using two stacks, one for the elements and one for tracking the minimum values.

5)Implement a Max Stack:
Similar to the previous question, implement a stack that supports finding the maximum element in constant time.

6)Histogram Area:
Given an array representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the largest rectangular area that can be formed by the bars. This can be solved efficiently using a stack.

7)Valid Parenthesis Expressions:
Given a string containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid. The brackets must be closed in the correct order.

8)Function Call Stack:
Simulate the behavior of a function call stack. Create functions for "push" (call a function), "pop" (return from a function), and "current_function" (get the name of the current function). Implement this using a stack data structure.

9)Implement a Stack with Limited Size:
Create a stack that has a maximum size. If push is called when the stack is full, it should return an error. Implement this using an array.

10)Implement a Queue Using Stacks:
Implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations.

11)Implement a Stack with Max API:
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the maximum element in constant time. How would you implement this efficiently?

12)Implement a Browser's Back/Forward Stack:
Implement a data structure that simulates a web browser's back and forward buttons. You should be able to go back and forward between visited pages.

13)Simplify Directory Path:
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it to the canonical path. For example, "/a/./b/../../c/" should be simplified to "/c."
